TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock clkdivider/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock sys_clk_pin and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock clkdivider/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin clkdivider/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins

TIMING-51#1 Critical Warning
No common phase between related clocks from parallel MMCMs or PLLs  
The clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 and sys_clk_pin are timed together but have no phase relationship. The design could fail in hardware. The clocks originate from two parallel MMCMs or PLLs and at least one of the block's clock dividers is not set to 1. To be safely timed, all parallel MMCMs or PLLs must have the clock divider set to 1.
