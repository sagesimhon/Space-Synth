Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.

WARNING: [DRC DPOP-1] PREG Output pipelining: DSP lfo/phase0 output lfo/phase0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.

WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net color_blobs/blue_cf/area_out_reg[11]_1 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin color_blobs/blue_cf/region_reg[1]_i_4/O, cell color_blobs/blue_cf/region_reg[1]_i_4. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
